#### Description
* `collect_data.R` collects data using library `Rtinder`. Install `Rtinder` from github.
*  `tinder_df.csv` supposedly has all the data that has been collected to this date.
*  Load `tinder_df.csv`. Then use the `collect_data` function to collect data and add the data to `tinder_df.csv`.
* `tinder_py2.ipynb` cleans and transforms `bio`-column from `tinder_df.csv` to a text file, `paragraph.txt`. This is useless now. We can remove it later
* `tinder_plot.ipynb`, load `tinder_df.csv` and run `main_clean_txt` function and you can figure it out from there.
