I enjoy an occasional cigarette and not so occasional cocktail/wine.

I like to feel challenged and learn from other people. I’ll always want the person I date to know more than I do in order to grow and expand my mind (in some capacity). I’m sure I’ll teach you a thing or two as well.

1) though it may seem “odd”, I’m not looking for a fuck. I can facilitate that quite easily offline. 

2) I do not drink and will not meet you at a bar or lounge. 

3) I won’t engage in one-sided conversations, I.e. I ask all the questions and you give boring answers.

Remember, you are the curator of your life, and with the unfailing positive force that is God (whatever that means to you) acting as a motor,  you will be successful.  Love yourself, protect your heart, open your mind, and harness your energy.
P.s. I'm kinda not looking to be involved with anyone but I'm down for interesting conversations.

I work hard at what i do even if its not what i would like to end up doing. I'm passionate about people i care for. In dire need of a cuddle buddy. hmu

I also love to make music in my free time, and I'm working on composing tracks for a small video game that I'm developing. Besides music and games, I'm also passionate about math, computer science, nature, and social justice.

I'm in an open relationship but am mainly looking to make more gay/queer friends to hang out and play video games with. If that sounds good to you, send me a message-- I would love to get to know you!

Huge foodie, love trying the “new weird” trendy foods. I work with children but I also have a passion for art. Self taught I’ve been painting for 3 years now and I love a moment to just sit and paint. I am Latina so food has also been a huge part of my life and is what brings my family together.

I also have many tattoos so if that’s a problem for you sorry not really.

New York is my favorite place and I would love to meet people to go out and about with, to be social and connect with.

I don’t drink or do drugs, even casually. I’m sober but not on a high but I’m not in a high horse.

**Im seeing someone so I'm only looking for friends and maybe fwbs 😊 Also, if you aren't from the city and just visiting, PLEASE say it in your profile!**

Despite usual annoyances, I'm definitely in love with New York and I love to explore it...it's just fun with more people. 

Talk to me about the arts and I'll be very giddy. And actually, just message me if we match. I obviously won't mind!

•Excellent credit score
•Own a passport and a library card
•No angry exes

•Borderline workaholic
•Will make you listen to all my favorite podcasts (Too many to list here. Ranges from The Weeds to The Read.)

It’s been a long while since I’ve dated, just trying to meet someone who would change my perception of humans as a species of assholes. 

I’m actually nice in person.

Currently taking an anthropology course that explains the root of why humans automatically want to “ mate” it’s super cool. While it has a lot to do with our animal instincts and research shows we can’t help it I want to save some time by saying I however am not looking to automatically “ mate” rather connect... another aspect we’ve evolved into doing... I hope.

Brooklyn should be independent
Certainty is a recipe for disaster
We don't talk about flags enough
Crisis and opportunity always coexist
Physical newspapers are better because you can’t roll up a cellphone and use it like a telescope
The American League is only nominally baseball
Monuments should be solemn

But if art is defined by the idea a viewer gets from the work that implies there is a vast range of thoughts and intimate associations any given person makes. So the role an artist plays is minimized since the definition opens up to anyone who is able to trigger any sort of connections in the viewer or interpreter","1998-01-08T18:01:34.034Z","tin","2019-01-05 13:01:34",1

Sometimes overly tough on the outside while also overly soft on the inside. Grammar guru (not Nazi 😅) and dog lover (but who isn’t?). Watermelon sour patch kids are life, and anything peanut butter is Heaven. Barre class is my obsession, but food is my everything.

I'd personally would like to find someone who is fun, and can be themselves around me. I love to talk so if you do too that's a plus!

Sometimes I keep a beard-beard. Sometimes I just keep a light stubble. Point is, I always have some facial hair, and hopefully you do you. 

I go to the gym regularly, hopefully you do too.

Traveling all the time.

J'adore le cinéma, les discussions autour d'un verre, les soirées film à deux, musées/expos...

Citoyen du monde, j'aime voyager et je voyage souvent. 

Je préfère un beau cerveau à un corps parfait.. 
Ça ne veut pas dire que le physique ne compte pas (je ne suis pas hypocrite).

Nice guy here. Would be cool to meet new people to have adventures with. Always down to grab drinks or explore the city (and beyond). I'll swipe right if I'm attracted to you and/or if I could see hanging out with you.

Open to a relationship, but let's not have that expectation when we meet. For me to want to be someone's bf, it starts by being really good friends first. Less pressure that way.

I eat food for a living (not a joke) 😬

Random likes:
Thunderstorms, old dogs, New York Sours, brunch, Parks and Rec, the color green, kayaking, fishing, giant fruit bats

Irrational dislikes:
White tube socks, fresh peaches, a wood popsicle stick that scrapes against your upper teeth

Bit of a nerd; love GRRM, documentaries, board games

I’ve been called ‘brave’ for being gay and eating the amount of carbs and cheese that I do and honestly, I’m rather proud of it","1991-01-11T19:03:58.272Z","tin","2019-01-08 14:04:01",0
